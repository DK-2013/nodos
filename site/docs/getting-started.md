```

<!-- ## Step 2: Start your Docusaurus site -->

<!-- Run the development server in the newly created `my-website` folder: -->

<!-- ```shell -->
<!-- cd my-website -->

<!-- npx docusaurus start -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Open `docs/getting-started.md` and edit some lines. The site reloads automatically and display your changes. -->
